In this hird and final part, the goal is to implement a filesystem **persistency** mechanism for _Jrava_.

To do this, **some useful information** is given:

- _Software design architecture_
    - **UML class diagram**, 
    - see `uml`


- _Specifications_
    - **Generated Javadoc** (Javadoc comments must be rewritten)
    - see `docs/index/html`


- _Implementation guidelines_
    - given as a document that gives details about persistency mechanism design and implementation, with a suggested class completion order
    - see `implementation-guidelines/index.html`
